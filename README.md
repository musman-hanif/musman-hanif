Hello, I'm Muhammad Usman Hanif, currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science at COMSATS University Islamabad, Lahore Campus.
I proudly hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Sargodha. My passion lies in the realm of cutting-edge technologies, 
particularly in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Deep Learning.

My skills are as diverse as my interests. I excel in freelancing, web development, UI/UX design, and have solid programming abilities in both JavaScript and Python. 
I take pride in my knack for generating innovative ideas and my solid grasp of Research Methodology, which has proven invaluable in my academic and professional journey.

Currently, I'm deeply engrossed in a research project focused on Satellite Imagery analysis, with the aim of predicting Urban Development, 
extracting Road Networks, and detecting Wildfires. This research not only showcases my technical prowess but also reflects my commitment to
leveraging technology for the greater good.

If you'd like to get in touch with me for a project or any other assistance, 
please feel free to contact me via email at musman.hanif5758@gmail.com
